**JS Framework:** AngularJS<br>
**External Dependencies:** [https://reqres.in/](https://reqres.in/) *- Mock API*

**This app is doing the following:**

- Calling another (Mock) RESTful API to display a list of staff

**Purpose of demo:** Demonstrate posting to and calling an API.

**To view locally run:**

The app should then load on http://localhost:3000/
